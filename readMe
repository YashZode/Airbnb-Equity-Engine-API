# 🏡 Airbnb Equity Engine API

A Flask-based backend API that promotes fairness and accessibility in Airbnb listings using machine learning. It evaluates listings, computes neighborhood fairness scores, and offers actionable tips for improving listing inclusivity.

---

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Predict **listing fairness** using a trained logistic regression model  
- 📊 Compute **fairness scores by neighborhood**  
- 🧠 Recommend listings that are both **affordable and accessible**  
- 💡 Provide **AI-based smart tips** to improve listing fairness  

---

## 📁 Dataset Used

The model uses a cleaned and preprocessed Airbnb dataset (`airbnb.csv`) that contains:
- Price, Beds, Room Type, Property Type
- Review Scores Rating
- Neighborhood info

Fairness is determined based on:
- **Affordability** (bottom 25% price)
- **Accessibility** (≥2 beds and not a shared room)
